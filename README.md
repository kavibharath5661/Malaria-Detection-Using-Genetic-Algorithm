# Malaria-Detection-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

This project applies MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and a Genetic Algorithm for hyperparameter optimization to classify blood smear images as parasitized or uninfected.  
Achieved 94% accuracy on test set with strong ROC-AUC performance.

Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras
- MobileNetV2 (transfer learning)
- Genetic Algorithm (hyperparameter optimization)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
